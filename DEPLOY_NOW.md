# Deploy Your Landing Page Now

Since you already have a Vercel account (https://vercel.com/nadavyigal-gmailcoms-projects), follow these simple steps to deploy your landing page:

## Quickest Method: Direct Web Deployment

1. **Log in to your Vercel account**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/nadavyigal-gmailcoms-projects
   - Make sure you're signed in

2. **Import your GitHub repository**
   - Click "Add New..." > "Project"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub" if prompted
   - Find and select the "nadavyigal/Michal-landing-page-" repository
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure your project**
   - Project Name: `michal-landing-page` (already set in your config files)
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave as default)
   - Keep all other settings as default

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait a few minutes while Vercel builds and deploys your project

5. **Visit your new site**
   - Once deployment is complete, you'll get a URL like: `michal-landing-page.vercel.app`
   - Vercel will also create a unique project URL like: `michal-landing-page-[unique-id].vercel.app`

## After Deployment

- Your site will automatically redeploy whenever you push new changes to GitHub
- You can add a custom domain through the Vercel dashboard if desired
- Vercel provides analytics and performance monitoring in your dashboard
